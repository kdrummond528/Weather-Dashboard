## Description and Usage

This application uses the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API for weather data. When you first deploy the application it will automatically load weather data for San Diego. If you enter another city name in the search bar, it will then load the data for the new city. The weather data included in the 5-day forecast are the temperature, wind, and humidity values.
